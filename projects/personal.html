                            Towards the end of University, I knew I would finish and then want to join the workforce within web development, however, my online image was not as i wanted. When i made my website back in 
                            2017/18, i wanted something that depersonalised me and made it seem like a business providing a service, Website design and development, however, now i feel that the site does not represent me or what I am, on top of looking
                            severely.
                            <br/>
                            I started by thinking of design ideas for the UX. I knew I wanted a mostly single page site where most information could be found, with tiny pages off for historic data.  
                            <br/>
                            <img loading="lazy"class="left-img" src="../Content/personal2021_intdes.jpg" style="clear:right" onclick="enlarge(event)">
                            From this, an initial set of 3 designs were made, pictured on the left, these were sent for deliberation, where they were wasked to pick their favour and method anything that would be obviously missing. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Design 2 was ultimately selected as the best option and work went underway to get the system up and running. Dreamweaver was selected as the software used to develop the system as no development languages were taught beforehand, 
                            but this was ultimately good as it allowed me to undertake a large writing piece using the waterfall methodology. 
                            <br/>
                            Resources such as images and videos were provided by the Sixth form and regular meetings were arraigned to keep the system within the spec of the clients. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Finally the system was then complete, and it was time to verify if the system was a success. It was decided that the system was a success, but looking now, it would have been good if it met more modern standards for designs.
                            <br/>
                            For this, responsive design should have been implemented so it reacts to different screens and orientations and displays in such a way that is is more clear for all users.
                            <br/><br/>
                            This was however a good starting point for me to explore websites and the beginning of a long path to understanding design and development methods to the point at which i do now.
